# Melodica Sheet Music

Sheet music adapted for melodica

---

The melodica is a charming piece of musical instrument, and it allows much freedom in creative music making. However, like any instrument, playing the melodica is like dancing in shackles: limitless imagination is presented within certain restrictions.

For example, two most common configurations of the melodica are the 32-key model and the 37-key model, featuring no more than three full sets of octaves. Moreover, for many (cheap) melodicas, it sounds badly to blow more than three keys at a time, making any chords more than a simple triad unfavorable.

In this project, I am going to make very simple adaptions to some sheet music so that it can be played on a melodica (or maybe melodicas, or maybe melodica plus some other musical instrument). The philosophy is to make the minimum changes possible, yet changes must be made when it is physically impossible for this instrument to play.

I am trying to use public domain resources, but if anything happen to be an infringement of anyone's right, it should be immediately removed upon notification.

The sheet music editor I am currently using is [MuseScore](https://www.musescore.com/). Users of other music software can import the [MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.com/) file provided.
